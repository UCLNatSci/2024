# Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism NSCI0033

## Introduction 

Classical mechanics provides the foundation for understanding the motion of particles and systems of particles, describing how forces interact with mass to produce motion. Developed largely by Isaac Newton, this framework includes a variety of essential concepts that allow us to analyse everything from a single moving particle to complex systems of interconnected masses.

In this course, we will cover:

- *Particle Motion*: the description of how particles move through space, including trajectory, velocity, and acceleration.
- *Newton's Laws*: Newton’s three laws of motion provide the core principles of classical mechanics. These laws define how forces affect the motion of particles, with Newton's second law, $ \vec{F} = m \vec{a} $, forming the critical link between force, mass, and acceleration.
- *Oscillations*: the study of periodic motion, such as simple harmonic motion, where restoring forces produce oscillatory behaviour. We’ll examine cases like springs and pendulums, fundamental to understanding many natural systems.
- *Gravity*: Newton’s universal law of gravitation describes the attractive force between masses, allowing us to predict planetary motion and explain phenomena such as orbits and tidal effects.
- *Systems of Particles*: when dealing with multiple particles, concepts like centre of mass, conservation of momentum, and internal versus external forces become important. These principles help us analyse interactions in systems ranging from molecules to stars.

As an additional topic, we will introduce **Lagrangian Mechanics**. This reformulation of classical mechanics uses the principle of least action to provide powerful methods for analysing more complex systems. The Lagrangian approach is not only valuable in classical mechanics but also serves as a stepping stone toward modern theories in physics.

Throughout, we will develop mathematical tools and use them to explore these principles, aiming to understand the predictable, clockwork-like behaviour of physical systems. This solid grounding in classical mechanics will serve as an essential basis for future studies in physics and engineering.

The four fundamental forces of nature are known to be:

- *Nuclear Strong*
- *Nuclear Weak*
- *Electromagnetic*
- *Gravity*

The main difference between the top two and bottom two are their range, nuclear forces are short range and really exist only within the confines of an atomic nucleus.  The bottom two forces are long range forces, which in their classical form follow inverse square laws (Coulomb's and Newton's respectively).

As we will see, electrostatics and the study of electric fields is often treated as one separate theory and the theory of magnetism can be thought of quite separately, 
however as we will see from a picture of moving charges and then Faraday's law, bringing the two theories together into electromagnetism is a major achievement.  
James Clark Maxwell's big contribution to classic physics is electromagnetism - in order to see this clearly, he wrote his much celebrated equations in differential form.  A lot of modern physics, such as quantum field theory and the standard model of particle physics relies on this unified formulation of electromagnetism. 

In this course we will cover the mathematical basics of electric fields, using flux.  This will leads us into Gauss's law which is a key idea in electrostatics and can be 
applied to many other analogue physical systems.  We can then find an analogous system of fields involved in Magnetism, which through Ampère's law allows us to link currents 
with magnetism.  Faraday's law finally allows us to go back from magnetic fields to produce potential differences and therefore electric fields.  We finish with a discussion of 
Maxwell's equations in differential form, in contrast to the integral form of equations that we started with.
