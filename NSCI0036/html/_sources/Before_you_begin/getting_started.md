# Set up your Cocalc Account

We will be using an online platform called **Cocalc** to run and edit **notebooks** which run **Python** code. Cocalc is a collaborative computing platform, which means that you can interactively share your code with other users of the platform.

> If you don't already have a Cocalc account associated with your long-form email address `firstname.surname.22@ucl.ac.uk`, then follow the steps below to create one.

1. Navigate to the Cocalc web site www.cocalc.com.
1. Click 'Sign Up'.
1. Agree to the terms of service then select `Jupyter` from the list.
1. Enter your long-form UCL email address `firstname.surname.22@ucl.ac.uk`, a new password of your choice and your first and last names.

After signing into your Cocalc account, you should see a Project titled something like `[your name] - NSCI0036_23_24`   . If you don't, this might be because you didn't use the correct email address in the previous step.

> Access your NSCI0036 Cocalc project:

1. Sign into Cocalc using your long-form UCL email address `firstname.surname.22@ucl.ac.uk`.
1. Click 'Projects' in the top-left corner.
1. Select the project `[your name] - NSCI0036_23_24`.
