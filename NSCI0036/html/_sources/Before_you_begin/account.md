# Set up your Cocalc Account

Before using CoCalc for the first time you will need to create an account. You will need to do this using your UCL email address, because a licensed, personal project has already been set up for you linked to that email. Follow the steps below to setup your account and access your project.

<h4> ✓  Create your account</h4>

> Open the Cocalc web site [www.cocalc.com](https://cocalc.com/auth/sign-up) and click ![Sign Up](sign_up.png). Enter the requested information to create your account. You must use your UCL email in its short form, which may be similar to [ucqsabc@ucl.ac.uk](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/?ref=MeControl).

<h4> ✓ Access your project</h4>

> Click on ![Projects](cocalc_projects.png) in the top-left corner.

You should see a project titled something like 'NSCI0036'.
> Click on the project 'NSCI0036' to open it.

Your project is essentially a virtual computer hosted in the cloud, including operating system (Linux) and preinstalled software libraries so that you can start programming with Python straight away.

```{attention}
If you don't see a project named 'NSCI0036', ask an instructor for help before continuing.
