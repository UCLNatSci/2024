    "Last week you used the following equations to model the dynamics of the [Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction) where $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the concentrations of the two reactants X (red) and Y (colourless) at timestep $i$. Each timestep is one second.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "X_{i+1} &= X_i + k_1-k_2X_i + k_3X_i^2Y_i\\\\\n",
    "Y_{i+1} &= Y_i + k_4X_i - k_3X_i^2Y_i.\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the parameter values $k_1=0.1$, $k_2=0.4$, $k_3=0.1$ and $k_4=0.2$, the system results in decaying oscillations of the concentrations $X$ and $Y$. Over time the system reaches equilibrium and the values of $X$ and $Y$ reach a steady state. The figure below shows the results of the simultion with initial condtions $X[0] = Y[0] = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Assuming the initial concentrations are zero, run the simulation with the parameters above for $1000$ time steps. Plot $X$ and $Y$ on the same figure, as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Assuming that the system has reached a steady state after 1000 timesteps, we can define the steady-state concentrations to be $X_{1000}$ and $Y_{1000}$. Determine the steady-state values of $X$ and $Y$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Write a function `steady_state_X(k1, k2, k3, k4)` which runs the simulation for the given values of $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$ and $k_4$, then returns the steady-state value of $X$. Check that it gives the expected value for $k_1=0.1$, $k_2=0.4$, $k_3=0.1$ and $k_4=0.2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "4\\. Determine the steady-state value of X for $k_1=0.1$, $k_2=0.4$, $k_3=0.1$ and a range of values of $k_4$ between $0$ and $0.3$. Plot the results on a graph with $k_4$ on the x-axis and the steady-state value of $X$ on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Write a function `max_X(k1, k2, k3, k4)` which returns the peak value of the concentration of X, then (on the same graph as the previous question) plot the peak concentration of X for $k_4$ between $0$ and $0.3$. (Use the `numpy` function `np.max` which returns the maximum value of an array).\n",
