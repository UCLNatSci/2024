    "The 2-moving average of `x` is formed by averaging the 2 values on either side of `x_i` (5 values in total). We can modify the for loop we just saw. The index of `x` should be extended by 1 on either side - from `i-2` to `i+3`. The for loop also needs to change, otherwise when `i=1` or `i=n-1` the subarray `x[i-2:i+3]` will go outside the bounds of `x`.\n",
