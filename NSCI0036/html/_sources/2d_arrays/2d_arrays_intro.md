# Modelling Space

Many scientific problems naturally involve modelling data in 2 or more dimensions. We have already understood how to manimpulate data in one dimension (time) using arrays, and this week we will extend our understanding to 2-dimensional arrays. 

```{admonition} What you'll learn
:class: tip
 - How to create and index 2 dimensional arrays
 - How to perform calculations on 2 dimensional arrays
```

## This Week

**Before class** read the [notes](2d_arrays_notes.ipynb) and complete embedded exercises.

**During class** work through the [workshop](2d_arrays.ipynb).

**During and after class** complete the [exercises](2d_arrays_homework.md).
