# Marking Scheme

High marks will only be awarded to reports which convincingly document a thorough investigation of the problem, presented in the style of a high-quality scientific report.

| Criterion      | Method | Results | Communication | Code |
| --- |---| --- | --- | --- |
|**Weighting**| 35% | 35% | 25% | 5% |
| **0 -- 3** | Simulation does not appear to solve the problem or contains major errors.| No meaningful results presented. | The report lacks structure and is difficult to understand. | Code does not execute or contains major flaws.|
|**4**| The simulation solves some of the problem, but may not be clearly described or contain some inaccuracies | At least one correct simulation run presented. | The report is structured into sections but is not coherent. At least one figure included which may not be properly formatted. | Code executes and produces some correct output, but may be disorganised or uncommented.|
|**5 -- 6**|The simulation correctly solves the problem and is clearly described with diagrams. | Several simulation runs presented, demonstrating a variety of behaviours of the simulation which are accurately described. | The report is fully structured and coherent but may be inconsistent between sections. Evidence of care in construction of the figures, for example captions and axis labels. | Code correctly solves the problem and makes use of functions and/or modules to aid organisation. Some comments included which aid the reader's understanding.|
|**7 -- 8**|The simulation correctly solves the problem and is described in sufficient detail (using accurate diagrams where appropriate) that the reader would be able to reproduce the simulation.| The simulation is investigated in detail and the results effectively presented enabling clear conclusions to be drawn.| The report is easy to follow and fully consistent throughout. Figures are professionally presented.| Code is well-organised and commented such that the reader would be able to adapt it for their own use.|
|**9 -- 10**|As above, but the simulation is highly novel or innovative. |The simulation is thoroughly investigated, with significant and notable results presented.|The report is exceptionally well structured, with results judiciously selected to clearly present the report's findings.| Code is clearly structured and extremely effective and efficient. |
