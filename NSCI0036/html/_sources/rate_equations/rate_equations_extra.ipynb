    "The [Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction), or BZ reaction, is a chemical reaction which exhibits non-equilbrium dynamics. Under certain conditions, the BZ reaction results in oscillatory behaviour, as demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMF4RjiITGM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The BZ reaction can be modelled by the following equations, where $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the concentrations of the two reactants X (red) and Y (colourless) at timestep $i$.\n",

    "2. Keeping the other parameters fixed, experiment with different values of $k_1$ between $0.1$ and $0.3$. For what range of values of $k_1$ does the reaction reach a steady-state, and for which values dos it exhibit sustained oscillations?\n",
