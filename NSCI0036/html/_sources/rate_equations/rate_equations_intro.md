# Modelling Change

One of the main goals of scientific computing is to simulate process that change with time. Last week we developed code that simulated exponential growth or decay, and this week we would like to extend this idea to model more general dynamical processes. We will need to understand how to store sequences of values, and then how to display the results graphically. This will require importing external Python libraries and a new type of loop.

```{admonition} What you'll learn
:class: tip
 - How to import and use Python libraries
 - How to use `numpy` arrays
 - How to repeat code using `for` loops
 - How to plot graphs using `matplotlib`
```
## This Week

**Before class** read the [notes](rate_equations_notes.ipynb) and complete the embedded exercises.

**During class** work through the [workshop](rate_equations.ipynb).

**During and after class** complete the [exercises](rate_equations_homework.md).
