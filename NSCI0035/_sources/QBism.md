# QBism (Quantum Bayesianism) in Quantum Mechanics

**QBism** (Quantum Bayesianism) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that applies Bayesian probability theory to the quantum framework. Developed by physicists such as Christopher Fuchs and Rüdiger Schack, QBism takes a subjective approach to quantum states, treating the wavefunction as a personal expression of an observer's beliefs rather than as an objective representation of reality. In QBism, quantum mechanics is viewed as a tool for individuals to make personal predictions about their future experiences.

QBism differs from other interpretations by emphasizing the subjective role of the observer and avoiding any notion of objective wavefunction collapse or multiple realities. It instead focuses on the observer's beliefs about measurement outcomes and how those beliefs are updated based on experience.

## Key Assumptions and Concepts

QBism builds on several foundational ideas, many of which are drawn from Bayesian probability theory, which treats probabilities as measures of personal belief rather than objective frequencies.

### Quantum States as Subjective Beliefs

In QBism, the **quantum state** (or wavefunction) does not represent an objective, external reality but rather an observer’s personal beliefs about the potential outcomes of a measurement. This interpretation treats quantum states as subjective, meaning they reflect the expectations of an individual agent rather than a real, physical property of a system.

- **Subjective Interpretation of the Wavefunction**: The wavefunction $ |\psi\rangle $ is considered a mathematical expression of the observer’s personal beliefs about possible outcomes, based on the information they have.
- **No Objective Reality of Quantum States**: There is no ontological status to the wavefunction outside of the observer’s mind. Quantum states do not exist as physical entities.

#### Example: Superposition in QBism

Consider an electron in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states along the $ z $-axis:
```{math}
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow_z \rangle + | \downarrow_z \rangle \right)
```
In QBism, this superposition is not a real, physical state of the electron. Instead, it represents the observer’s personal belief that the electron has a 50% chance of being measured as spin-up and a 50% chance of being spin-down. The superposition does not exist independently of the observer's knowledge.

### Measurement as Personal Experience

In QBism, **measurement** is not an objective process that reveals a pre-existing property of a system. Instead, it is an interaction between the observer and the system, resulting in an outcome that the observer experiences personally. Measurement outcomes do not reveal an objective reality; rather, they are updates to the observer's beliefs.

- **Observer-Centric**: Measurement is a personal experience unique to each observer. It does not uncover an objective fact about the system, but rather provides information that the observer uses to update their beliefs.
- **Belief Updating**: Upon measurement, the observer updates their prior beliefs based on the outcome, following the rules of Bayesian probability.

#### Example: Spin Measurement in QBism

Suppose an observer has assigned a quantum state $ |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle \right) $ to an electron’s spin along the $ z $-axis. If the observer measures spin and finds it to be up, they update their beliefs accordingly. However, this outcome does not imply an objective collapse of the wavefunction. It merely updates the observer's subjective beliefs about future measurements on similar systems.

### The Born Rule as a Guide to Consistent Belief Updating

In QBism, the **Born rule** is interpreted as a tool that guides the observer on how to update their beliefs in a consistent manner. Instead of treating the Born rule as an objective law of nature, QBism sees it as a "norm" or rule of thumb that helps observers assign probabilities to measurement outcomes.

- **Born Rule as a Norm**: The Born rule provides a guideline for how an observer should assign probabilities to potential measurement outcomes. It ensures that observers’ beliefs remain internally consistent.
- **Probability as Personal Expectation**: The probabilities derived from the Born rule are not objective frequencies but personal expectations based on the observer’s information and beliefs.

#### Example Calculation: Using the Born Rule in QBism

An observer assigns a quantum state $ |\psi\rangle = \sqrt{0.7} | \uparrow \rangle + \sqrt{0.3} | \downarrow \rangle $ to an electron’s spin along the $ z $-axis. According to the Born rule, the observer calculates the probability of measuring spin-up as:
```{math}
P(\uparrow) = |\langle \uparrow | \psi \rangle|^2 = 0.7
```
and the probability of measuring spin-down as:
```{math}
P(\downarrow) = |\langle \downarrow | \psi \rangle|^2 = 0.3
```	
In QBism, these probabilities represent the observer's personal expectations about the measurement outcome, not objective properties of the electron.

### The Observer as a Central Agent

QBism places the **observer** at the center of the quantum formalism. Each observer has their own wavefunction for a system, and the wavefunction only has meaning relative to the beliefs and knowledge of that observer. Observers are not interchangeable; each has a unique perspective and set of beliefs.

- **Individual Perspective**: Each observer’s quantum state is personal, reflecting their own beliefs. If two observers have different information, they may assign different quantum states to the same system.
- **No Objective Quantum State**: There is no universal, objective quantum state. Each observer’s wavefunction is subjective and applies only to their personal experience.

### Quantum Mechanics as a Tool for Decision-Making

In QBism, quantum mechanics is understood as a practical tool that observers use to make decisions and manage expectations. The theory does not attempt to describe an objective external reality; rather, it provides a framework for agents to make rational choices about future experiences.

- **Instrumentalist Interpretation**: Quantum mechanics is an instrument for predicting outcomes, not a description of an objective world.
- **Decision Theory**: Observers use quantum mechanics as a decision-making framework, applying the Born rule and Bayesian reasoning to make consistent predictions.

### Avoidance of the Measurement Problem

Because QBism treats quantum states as subjective and does not assume they reflect an objective reality, it avoids the traditional **measurement problem** in quantum mechanics. There is no need to explain wavefunction collapse or the "reality" of superpositions since these are purely subjective elements in the QBist framework.

- **No Wavefunction Collapse**: Measurement does not collapse the wavefunction; it only updates the observer's beliefs. The concept of collapse is unnecessary.
- **No Ontological Superpositions**: Superpositions are not real, physical states but rather subjective descriptions of belief, so no "collapse" is needed to select a single outcome.

## Differences Between QBism and Other Interpretations

QBism differs from other interpretations in its treatment of quantum states, measurement, and the nature of reality.

###  Copenhagen Interpretation

The **Copenhagen interpretation** views the wavefunction as a tool for calculating probabilities, but it also suggests that measurement collapses the wavefunction to a single outcome. In QBism, there is no collapse, and the wavefunction is purely subjective, representing personal beliefs.

- **Wavefunction**: In Copenhagen, the wavefunction is tied to measurement collapse, whereas in QBism, it is purely subjective.
- **Collapse**: The Copenhagen interpretation requires collapse, while QBism does not.

###  Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)

The **Many-Worlds Interpretation** posits that all possible outcomes of a measurement occur in separate branches of the universe. In QBism, there are no branching universes or objective multiple outcomes. Instead, each measurement updates the observer’s personal beliefs.

- **Objective Reality**: MWI assumes all possible outcomes are real in parallel universes, while QBism denies any objective existence to the wavefunction.
- **No Branching**: QBism involves no branching universes, only subjective belief updates.

###  Bohmian Mechanics

**Bohmian Mechanics** is a deterministic theory in which particles have well-defined positions and are guided by a pilot wave. In QBism, particles do not have objective properties, and the wavefunction is not a real guiding field but a subjective belief of the observer.

- **Determinism vs. Subjectivism**: Bohmian Mechanics is deterministic, whereas QBism is fundamentally subjective and probabilistic.
- **Wavefunction as Real vs. Belief**: In Bohmian Mechanics, the wavefunction is real, while in QBism, it is an expression of belief.
