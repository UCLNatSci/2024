Here’s a list of different interpretations of quantum mechanics, each offering a unique perspective on wavefunctions, measurement, and the nature of reality.

### 1. **Copenhagen Interpretation**
   - The wavefunction represents a probability distribution that collapses upon measurement, and measurement outcomes are determined by the act of observation.
   
### 2. **Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)**
   - All possible outcomes of a quantum measurement occur in parallel, branching universes, with no wavefunction collapse.

### 3. **Bohmian Mechanics (Pilot Wave Theory)**
   - Particles have definite positions and are guided by a pilot wave (the wavefunction), following deterministic trajectories.

### 4. **Objective Collapse Theories**
   - The wavefunction spontaneously collapses as a physical process, without requiring measurement. Examples include the **GRW (Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber)** model and **Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL)**.

### 5. **QBism (Quantum Bayesianism)**
   - Quantum states are subjective beliefs, and the wavefunction represents an observer’s personal expectations, with no objective reality or collapse.

### 6. **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)**
   - The properties of quantum systems are relative to other systems (or observers), with no absolute or objective state.

### 7. **Transactional Interpretation**
   - Quantum events are understood as "handshakes" between particles, where advanced and retarded waves interact in a time-symmetric manner, leading to the collapse.

### 8. **Consistent Histories**
   - Quantum mechanics describes possible histories of a system, and probabilities are assigned to entire histories, with no need for wavefunction collapse.

### 9. **Stochastic Interpretation**
   - Quantum processes are driven by random fluctuations, with particles experiencing continuous, stochastic motion that underlies probabilistic outcomes.

### 10. **Montevideo Interpretation**
   - Based on quantum gravity effects, time itself has inherent uncertainty, leading to fundamental decoherence and effective collapse without the need for an observer.

### 11. **Many-Minds Interpretation**
   - A variation of Many-Worlds where each observer’s mind branches into multiple versions corresponding to each possible outcome, while physical reality remains unified.

### 12. **Thermodynamic Interpretation**
   - Wavefunction collapse is viewed as a thermodynamic process, driven by entropy and irreversible processes, particularly in the context of large systems.

### 13. **Information-Based Interpretations**
   - Quantum states represent information about measurement outcomes rather than real physical entities. Examples include **Quantum Darwinism** and **Relational Quantum Mechanics**.

### 14. **Penrose’s Objective Reduction (OR)**
   - Wavefunction collapse is tied to gravitational effects, suggesting that large superpositions collapse due to gravitational instability (related to Penrose’s ideas on quantum gravity).

These interpretations differ widely in how they address fundamental questions of quantum mechanics, such as the role of measurement, the existence of wavefunction collapse, and the nature of reality, each offering unique insights and solutions to quantum paradoxes and the measurement problem.
