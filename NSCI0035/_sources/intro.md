# Welcome to Foundations of Quantum Mechanics NSCI0035

This module aims to equip students with tools to understand a little more deeply the big questions and philosophical foundations of modern quantum mechanics as well as how different interpretations of quantum mechanics may be required to fully grapple with these issues.

This module aims to cover questions about:
- measurement
- locality
- ontology
- determinism
in quantum mechanics as well as cover a variety of interpretations:
- Copenhagen 
- Pilot Wave / de Borglie Bohm
- Objective Collapse Models
- Many Worlds 

We hope you leave this module with a richer sense of the modern questions within the foundations of modern physics.
