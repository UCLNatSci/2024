# Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of Quantum Mechanics

The **Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)** of quantum mechanics was proposed by Hugh Everett III in the 1950s. MWI is an alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation, positing that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements actually occur, each in its own separate, branching universe. According to MWI, there is no wavefunction collapse; instead, the universe "splits" or "branches" into multiple versions of itself, with each version representing a different possible outcome of a measurement.

## Key Assumptions and Concepts

MWI introduces several unique ideas about the nature of reality, quantum states, and measurement, distinguishing it from other interpretations.

### The Universal Wavefunction

In MWI, the wavefunction $ |\Psi\rangle $ of the entire universe is considered a real, physical entity. This **universal wavefunction** evolves deterministically according to the Schrödinger equation, encompassing all possible states of all particles and systems within it.

- **Deterministic Evolution**: The universal wavefunction evolves without collapse, governed by the Schrödinger equation. All possible outcomes of every quantum event are contained within it.
- **No Collapse**: Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, which requires the wavefunction to collapse to a single outcome upon measurement, MWI holds that the wavefunction never collapses. Instead, it constantly branches to include all possible measurement outcomes.

### Branching and the Multiverse

The Many-Worlds Interpretation posits that every time a quantum measurement occurs, the universe **branches** into multiple, parallel versions, each representing a different possible measurement outcome.

- **Branching Universes**: When a quantum system is measured, the universe splits into separate branches, each containing a copy of the system, the observer, and the environment, with each branch representing a different outcome.
- **The Multiverse**: These branches are often collectively referred to as the "multiverse," a collection of parallel universes where every possible outcome of every quantum event is realized.

#### Example: Schrödinger’s Cat

In the classic **Schrödinger’s cat** thought experiment, a cat in a closed box is placed in a superposition of being both alive and dead until observed. In MWI, the act of opening the box causes the universe to branch into two versions: one in which the cat is alive, and another in which the cat is dead. Both outcomes occur, but in separate, non-interacting branches of the universe.

### Measurement as Branching, Not Collapse

In MWI, measurement is understood as a branching process rather than a collapse of the wavefunction. When a measurement is made, the wavefunction of the universe splits into branches that correspond to each possible outcome of the measurement.

- **No Observer-Triggered Collapse**: Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, MWI does not require an observer to collapse the wavefunction. Instead, measurement merely reveals the branching that naturally occurs as part of the wavefunction's deterministic evolution.
- **Observer’s Perspective**: Each observer experiences only one outcome of a measurement in their branch, but in reality, all outcomes exist across different branches.

#### Example Calculation: Spin Measurement in MWI

Suppose an electron is in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states along the $ z $-axis:
```{math}
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow_z \rangle + | \downarrow_z \rangle \right)
```
If an observer measures the spin, the universal wavefunction branches into two components:
```{math}
|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( | \uparrow_z \rangle \otimes |\text{Observer sees } \uparrow_z \rangle + | \downarrow_z \rangle \otimes |\text{Observer sees } \downarrow_z \rangle \right)
```
After the measurement, there are two non-interacting branches of the universe—one where the observer sees spin-up and another where the observer sees spin-down. Each outcome exists independently, with the observer in each branch perceiving only one result.

### Determinism and Reality of All Outcomes

MWI is a deterministic theory, meaning that the evolution of the universal wavefunction is entirely governed by the Schrödinger equation, without any randomness or collapse. Every possible outcome of a quantum event is realized in some branch of the multiverse.

- **Determinism**: The universal wavefunction evolves predictably, with no collapse or randomness at the fundamental level.
- **Realism of Branches**: All branches are considered equally real, meaning every possible outcome has an objective existence in its own universe.

### Probability and the Born Rule

A key challenge for MWI is to explain the **Born rule**—the rule that gives the probability of observing each outcome as the squared amplitude of the wavefunction. Since all outcomes occur in MWI, probability in the usual sense does not seem to apply, as there is no "chance" of one outcome over another.

- **Self-Locating Uncertainty**: In MWI, probability is often reinterpreted as a form of "self-locating uncertainty" where an observer is uncertain about which branch they will find themselves in after measurement.
- **Derivation Attempts**: Some proponents of MWI argue that the Born rule can be derived by considering the relative "measure" or "weight" of branches. The squared amplitude of each outcome is thought to correspond to the proportion of observers who will experience that outcome in the multiverse.

#### Example Calculation: Born Rule and Probability in MWI

Consider an electron in the superposition:
```{math}
|\psi\rangle = \sqrt{0.7} | \uparrow \rangle + \sqrt{0.3} | \downarrow \rangle
```
When a measurement is made, the universe splits into two branches. According to the Born rule, we expect a 70% chance of observing spin-up and a 30% chance of spin-down. In MWI, this means that 70% of the observers in the multiverse experience the spin-up result, and 30% experience the spin-down result, with the "measure" of each branch corresponding to the squared amplitude $ 0.7 $ and $ 0.3 $, respectively.

### Decoherence and Branch Independence

In MWI, **decoherence** plays a critical role in ensuring that branches of the multiverse do not interfere with each other after a measurement. Decoherence is the process by which quantum superpositions become effectively classical due to interactions with the environment, causing each branch to evolve independently.

- **Environment-Induced Decoherence**: When a measurement is made, interactions with the environment lead to decoherence, which suppresses interference between branches.
- **Independence of Branches**: Once decoherence has occurred, branches evolve as separate, non-interacting worlds, ensuring that observers in different branches cannot detect or influence each other.

#### Example: Decoherence in the Double-Slit Experiment

In the double-slit experiment, an electron passes through both slits and forms an interference pattern on a screen. In MWI, each possible path of the electron corresponds to a different branch of the universe. If a detector is placed at the slits to observe which slit the electron goes through, decoherence occurs, resulting in separate branches where the electron went through each slit, destroying the interference pattern.

## Differences Between MWI and Other Interpretations

MWI contrasts with other interpretations of quantum mechanics in its treatment of wavefunction collapse, measurement, and the nature of reality.

### Copenhagen Interpretation

In the **Copenhagen interpretation**, measurement causes the wavefunction to collapse to a single outcome. In MWI, all possible outcomes occur, with the wavefunction never collapsing.

- **Collapse**: MWI has no collapse, while Copenhagen requires collapse upon measurement.
- **Reality of All Outcomes**: MWI asserts that all outcomes exist in separate branches, whereas the Copenhagen interpretation suggests only one outcome is real.

### Bohmian Mechanics

**Bohmian Mechanics** (or Pilot Wave Theory) assumes that particles have definite trajectories, guided by a pilot wave. Unlike MWI, Bohmian Mechanics is a deterministic theory that does not require multiple universes.

- **Branching**: MWI posits multiple universes, while Bohmian Mechanics involves a single deterministic universe.
- **Wavefunction’s Role**: In MWI, the wavefunction represents a real multiverse, whereas in Bohmian Mechanics, it acts as a guiding field for particles.

### Objective Collapse Theories

**Objective Collapse Theories** propose mechanisms by which the wavefunction collapses to a single outcome. MWI avoids collapse altogether by allowing all outcomes to exist in separate branches.

- **Collapse Mechanism**: Objective collapse theories posit physical mechanisms for wavefunction collapse, while MWI has no collapse.
- **Realism of All Outcomes**: MWI allows all possible outcomes to coexist in separate branches, whereas objective collapse theories assert that only one outcome becomes real.
