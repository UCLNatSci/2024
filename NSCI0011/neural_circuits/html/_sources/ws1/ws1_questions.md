:label: exercise_undirected_graph_G

Let $G$ be the undirected graph represented by the following adjacency list.

```
[[5, 6], [7], [7], [], [7], [0, 6], [0, 5], [1, 2, 4]]
```

1\. Sketch (by hand) the undirected graph $G$ and (by eye) determine the connected components.

2\. Using a `for` loop, apply the function `bfs(adj, i)` to every node of $G$ and print the result for each.

3\. The *distance matrix* of a graph is an `n` by `n` array `d` such that `d[i,j]` is the path distance between node `i` and node `j`. Calculate the distance matrix of $G$.

1\. Determine the adjacency list of the directed graph below.

2\. Write a function `print_length_2_walks(adj, i)` which prints out all length 2 walks starting from node `i`. Test that it produces the correct output for node `8`:

```
>>> print_length_3_walks(adj, 8)
8 3 2
8 6 4
8 6 5
```

3\. Write a function `print_length_2_paths(adj, i)` which prints out all length 2 *paths* starting from node `i`.

4\. Under what circumstances would the two functions produce different results?

The *reverse* of a directed graph is is the graph formed by reversing the directions of its edges.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose_graph

1\. Sketch the reverse of the directed graph of the egg-laying circuit and write down its adjacency list.  
2\. Write a function `reverse(adj)` which reverses the adjacency list `adj`. That is, if `adj` is the adjacency list of a directed graph, then `reverse(adj)` is the adjacency list of the reverse graph.  
3\. Check that your function correctly reverses the adjacency list of the egg-laying circuit.
