# Random Graphs

```{admonition} definition

A **random graph** is a graph in which the edges are determined in a random way. Given a set of $n$ nodes and edge probability $p$, we define a random simple digraph such that for each node pair $i, j$ $(i\neq j)$ there exists an edge $(i, j)$ with probability $p$.

This definition of random graph is more properly called an **Erdös-Rényi** random graph.

We can easily generate random directed graphs using the adjacency matrix graph representation. For a simple digraph, diagonal elements of the matrix are 0, each other element is 1 with probability $p$ and 0 with probability $1-p$.

## Question

1. What is the expected number of edges of a random digraph with $n$ nodes and edge probability $p$?
2. Write a program which, given integer $n$ and probability $p$, generates a random simple digraph and determines if it is connected.
3. Use your script to estimate the probability that a random directed graph with 10 nodes and $p= 0.1$ is connected.

## Null Models

What do the graph statistics that we have studied --- such as degree distribution and average path length --- tell us about brain circuits? These statistics scale with the number of edges and nodes in the graph, and so depend on the graph size and connection density as well as other basic properties of the graph.

Given a graph of a neural circuit, a **null model** is a random graph with identical basic properties such as number of nodes and edges. By comparing global properties of the neural circuit graph with the random graph, it is possible to determine whether the properties of the circuit are large or small in relation to the null model.

### Example

The graph of a region of the *Drosophila* connectome, PED\(R\), with connection weight greater than or equal to 10, has $n=197$ nodes and $e=516$ edges, resulting in an edge probability of $p=e/(n^2-n)=0.0134$. We construct a null model consisting of a random graph with $n=197$ nodes and edge probability $p=0.0134$.

PED\(R\) has average path length 2.1 and global clustering coefficient 0.69, compared to 5.3 and 0.02 for the null model.

The **normalised** average path length and global clustering coefficient are $2.1/5.3=0.40$ and $0.69/0.02=34.5$ respectively.

%Consider a pair of nodes in a graph. There are four possible ways they may be connected.

%\\
%However, the first subgraph is not connected, and the second and third subgraphs are isomorphic to each other. So there are in fact only two possibilities for connected subgraphs of order 2.
%
%\
%\\
%If we consider triplets of nodes, then there are 13 possible ways they may be connected (Figure~\ref{fig:triplets}). Any connected order 3 subgraph is isomorphic to one of these.
%\ \\
%Each of the possibilities is termed an \textbf{isomorphism class}.

%\\
%A \textbf{network motif} of order $n$ is defined as a connected subgraph consisting of $n$ nodes. For a given $n$, the network motif belongs to one of the order $n$ isomorphism classes.
%
%\ \\
%Usually we are interested in motifs which are statistically overrepresented. That is, they appear more often than we would expect by chance.
%
%\begin{question}
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Which of the 13 order 3 digraphs are contained in the egg-laying circuit?
%		\item $G$ is a connected order 6 digraph whose only order 3 network motif is $m_1^3$. Draw $G$.
%		\item How many distinct adjacency matrices define a graph isomorphic to $m_9^3$?
