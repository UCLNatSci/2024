# Isomorphic Graphs

We say that two graphs are *isomorphic* if they have the same network structure. Graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic if there exists a matching between their nodes such that two nodes are connected by an edge in $G_1$ if and only if their corresponding nodes are connected by an edge in $G_2$.

```{admonition} Definition
An **isomorphsim** between two graphs $(V_1, E_1)$ and $(V_2, E_2)$ is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence)

$$f\colon V_1\to V_2$$

such that $(v_1, v_2)$ is in $E_1$ if and only if $(f(v_1), f(v_2))$ is in $E_2$.

If an isomorphism exists between two graphs, we say that the graphs are **isomorphic**.

## Example

Find an isomorphism between the following two graphs.

**Solution**

These two graphs are isomorphic under the isomorphism $f\colon \{1, 2, 3\}\to \{A, B, C\}$ where $f(1) = C, f(2) = B $ and $f(3) = A$.

## Question 1

1\. Find an isomorphism between the following two directed graphs:

2\. Find a subgraph of the egg-laying circuit isomorphic to the directed graph below.

3\. Use NetworkX functions `subgraph` and `is_isomorphic` to confirm your answer to 2.

## Example

How many simple directed graphs are there with 3 nodes and two edges?

**Solution**

There are 4. Any other simple directed digraph with 3 nodes and 2 edges is isomorphic to one of these.

## Question 2

Draw all simple directed graphs with 3 nodes and 3 edges.

### Isomorphism from Adjacency Matrix

Given two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, we can check whether they are isomorphic by calculating the adjacency matrix of every permutation of the nodes of $G_1$. If one of them is equal to the adjacency matrix of $G_2$, then the two graphs are isomorphic.

There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ nodes, so even for relatively small graphs, checking for isomorphism can take a long time. There are $2.4\times 10^{24}$ possible permutations of a graph with 20 nodes.

## Question 3

Write down all $3! = 6$ adjacency matrices of the following digraph.

## Graph Invariants

Fortunately, the problem of checking whether two graphs are *not* isomorphic is often easier. For example, if $G_1$ has 5 nodes and $G_2$ has 6 nodes, they certainly are not isomorphic. A graph property which is preserved by isomorphism is called a **graph invariant**.

Some examples of graph invariants:

1. Number of nodes
2. Number of edges
3. Maximum node degree
4. Number of triangle (3-cycle) subgraphs
5. Number of connected components

## Question

1\. Show that the following pairs of graphs are not isomorphic by finding an invariant that they do not share.
