# Homework

You should submit a single `.py` file which contains answers to the following questions. Explanations should be formatted as Python comments.

## Question 1

Complete {numref}`exercise_increase_by_one`

 ***1 mark** for identifying the correct case, **1 mark** for writing the function and **2 marks** each for three correct and complete explanations.*

## Question 2

Write a function `swap_lists(x, y)` which swaps any two lists in-place. For example,

```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = [5, 6, 7]
>>> swap_lists(a, b)
>>> a
[5, 6, 7]
>>> b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Explain why it is not possible to write a function `swap_strings(x, y)` which swaps two strings `x` and `y`.

***4 marks** for a correct function and **1 mark** for the explanation.*

[Total: **13 marks**]
