    "One way to swap the two arrays is to make a temporary copy of the values. Perhaps the simplest way to do this is to copy all of the value into a temporary array first. This works:\n",

    "Note that this works because `x[:]` makes a copy of the values of `x`. Another way to do the exact same is `x.copy()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is fine, but we might like to consider if there are other solutions which don't require making a copy of the list elements. For example, the following code moves one value at a time from `x` to `y` then one item at a time from `y` to `x`. Note that we must be careful to move items in the correct order - otherwise we end up revering the list!\n",
