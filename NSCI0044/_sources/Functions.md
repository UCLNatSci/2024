### Inverse Functions

So far we have defined a function $ y=y(x) $, but given this, is it possible to reverse the function to find $ x=x(y) $? This reversing of the function process is called finding the **inverse** function. The notation for the inverse of a function $ f(x) $ is $ f^{-1}(x) $. This is often confused with the **reciprocal** function $ \frac{1}{f(x)} $. For trigonometric functions, the prefix "arc" is commonly added to indicate the inverse function, such as $ \arcsin(x) $ etc.

### Algorithm for Finding Inverse
A simple method of finding the inverse of a function is first to write it out using two variables, for example, using $ x $ as the independent variable and $ y $ as the dependent variable:

```{math}
f(x): \quad y = (x+1)^2 - 3
```

Then swap the variable letters:

```{math}
f^{-1}(x): \quad x = (y+1)^2 - 3
```

Finally, rewrite this equation making $ y $ the subject:

```{math}
f^{-1}(x): \quad x + 3 = (y+1)^2 \Rightarrow \sqrt{x+3}  = y + 1
```
```{math}
f^{-1}(x): \quad y = \sqrt{x+3} - 1
```

This is now our inverse function.

In finding the inverse, we need to first consider the domain and co-domain. Strictly speaking, these swap around. For example:

```{math}
f(x) = x^2, \, x \in (-\infty,\infty), \, f(x) \in [0,\infty)
```
```{math}
f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}, \, x \in [0,\infty), \, f^{-1}(x) \in [0,\infty)
```

### Examples of Well-Known Inverse Functions
The exponential and logarithm functions are the inverse of each other, and if we plot them, we can see the mirror image over the line $ y = x $.

## Even and Odd Functions

In mathematics, an even function is a real function such that $ f(-x) = f(x) $ for every $ x $ in its domain. Similarly, an odd function is a function such that $ f(-x) = -f(x) $ for every $ x $ in its domain.

They are named for the parity of the powers of the power functions which satisfy each condition: the function $ f(x) = x^n $ is even if $n$ is an even integer, and it is odd if $n$ is an odd integer.

Even functions are those real functions whose graph is self-symmetric with respect to the $ y $-axis, and odd functions are those whose graph is self-symmetric with respect to the origin.

If the domain of a real function is self-symmetric with respect to the origin, then the function can be uniquely decomposed as the sum of an even function and an odd function.

### Definition and examples

Evenness and oddness are generally considered for real functions, that is, real-valued functions of a real variable. However, the concepts may be more generally defined for functions whose domain and codomain both have a notion of additive inverse. This includes abelian groups, all rings, all fields, and all vector spaces. Thus, for example, a real function could be odd or even (or neither), as could a complex-valued function of a vector variable, and so on.

The given examples are real functions, to illustrate the symmetry of their graphs.

### Even functions

![Function $x^2$](funx2.png)  
$ f(x) = x^2 $ is an example of an even function.

A real function $ f $ is even if, for every $ x $ in its domain, $ -x $ is also in its domain and:
```{math}
f(-x) = f(x)
```
or equivalently
```{math}
f(x) - f(-x) = 0.
```

Geometrically, the graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the $ y $-axis, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after reflection about the $ y $-axis.

Examples of even functions are:
- The absolute value $ x \mapsto |x| $
- $ x \mapsto x^2 $
- $ x \mapsto x^4 $
- Cosine $ \cos $
- Gaussian function $ x \mapsto \exp(-x^2) $

### Odd functions

![Function $x^3$](funx3.png)  
$ f(x) = x^3 $ is an example of an odd function.

A real function $ f $ is odd if, for every $ x $ in its domain, $ -x $ is also in its domain and:
```{math}
f(-x) = -f(x)
```
or equivalently 
```{math}
f(x) + f(-x) = 0.
```

Geometrically, the graph of an odd function has rotational symmetry with respect to the origin, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after rotation of 180 degrees about the origin.

If $ x = 0 $ is in the domain of an odd function $ f(x) $, then $ f(0) = 0 $.

Examples of odd functions are:
- The sign function $ x \mapsto \mathrm{sign}(x) $
- The identity function $ x \mapsto x $
- $ x \mapsto x^3 $
- Sine $ \sin $

![Function $x^3 + 1$](funx31.png)  
$ f(x) = x^3 + 1 $ is neither even nor odd.

### Uniqueness
- If a function is both even and odd, it is equal to 0 everywhere it is defined.
- If a function is odd, the **absolute value** of that function is an even function.

### Addition and subtraction
- The **sum** of two even functions is even.
- The sum of two odd functions is odd.
- The **difference** between two odd functions is odd.
- The difference between two even functions is even.
- The sum of an even and odd function is not even or odd unless one of the functions is equal to zero over the given **domain**.

### Multiplication and division
- The **product** of two even functions is an even function.
  - That implies that the product of any number of even functions is an even function as well.
- The product of two odd functions is an even function.
- The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.
- The **quotient** of two even functions is an even function.
- The quotient of two odd functions is an even function.
- The quotient of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.

### Composition
- The **composition** of two even functions is even.
- The composition of two odd functions is odd.
- The composition of an even function and an odd function is even.
- The composition of any function with an even function is even (but not vice versa).

### Evenâ€“odd decomposition
If a real function has a domain that is self-symmetric with respect to the origin, it may be uniquely decomposed as the sum of an even and an odd function, which are called respectively the **even part** and the **odd part** of the function, and are defined by
```{math}
f_\text{even}(x) = \frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2},
```
and
```{math}
f_\text{odd}(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(-x)}{2}.
```

It is straightforward to verify that $ f_\text{even} $ is even, $ f_\text{odd} $ is odd, and $ f = f_\text{even} + f_\text{odd} $.

This decomposition is unique since, if
```{math}
f(x) = g(x) + h(x),
```
where $ g $ is even and $ h $ is odd, then $ g = f_\text{even} $ and $ h = f_\text{odd} $, since
```{math}
\begin{align*}
2f_\text{even}(x) &= f(x) + f(-x) = g(x) + g(-x) + h(x) + h(-x) = 2g(x), \\
2f_\text{odd}(x) &= f(x) - f(-x) = g(x) - g(-x) + h(x) - h(-x) = 2h(x).
\end{align*}
```
